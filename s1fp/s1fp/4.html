        Inspired by the hit 2010 Katy Perry pop song, "California Gurls", 
        I'm wearing a totally sweet fit. In the music video, Katy makes
        her way through Candy Land - lying on cotton candy clouds, freeing women/fellow "California Gurls,"
        and eventually defeating Snoop Dogg's army of enraged gummy bears.
