        <p> CATS PLAYING MAHJONG </p>
        <br>
        <p> OVERVIEW </p>
        <p> In small groups of 2 or 3, students will work together to establish a system that individual students will then utilize to recreate an image with Binary, ASCII, or Unicode characters. Groups may reconvene to reassess their group’s systems or individual students may “fork the code” (within reason) to better serve their images. Final text images must be a minimum of 60 character rows/columns along the shortest edge.
        <br>
        <p> <span style="font-weight:bolder">The final project's system requires: utilization of Mahjong Tile characters, a call to Chinese culture, and a freedom with color.</span></p>

        <p> OVERVIEW </p>
        <p> Students will design and write a program or script to be performed. This can be taken literally, as in your script is intended to be enlivened by actors. This can be taken loosely and all terms can be creatively interpreted. Regardless, all performances must incorporate learned principles of scripted “functions,” and must also include an element of “chance.”

            var trailText = 'The experience of Mail Art as a whole seems deeply special from an individual recipients viewpoint. One understands that their name was selected to be put onto an exclusive mail list. They hold a package/envelope - which has travelled from Point A through possibly countless other places and hands - before tearing into a work directly touched by its creator. They have the opportunity to add on to this work, making their own mark, before continuing the flow. When I think about this experience, I understand the power of the Mail Art movement and the connections it must have inspired. I feel the metaphors Schwulst uses to shape the possibilities/perspectives of the internet are widely applicable to various aspects of life - friendships, journal entries, a recipe in the kitchen, etc. Still, I find it refreshing to think about the internet in these artistic and almost literary ways, and it adds life to my personal viewpoint of the web - which I mainly view as a tool in my daily life. Her call to reclaim the internet as individuals from big corporations especially resonates with me, as my first (and most dominant) exposure to the internet was through social media. The table comparing and sorting digital and physical print features is really interesting to go through, and it is something I think about often. I find it especially interesting in Ludovicos remark as heavy encyclopedias being considered more of a status symbol rather than something people actually use for information. Personally, I prefer print materials - the physicality of turning pages, seeing how much Ive read and still have to go through, and holding a book in my hands - features that cant necessarily be translated into the digital. Yet, while I admonish Kindle users and feel a sense of pride in myself sticking to physical print, I cant help but acknowledge the ease, convenience, creative potential, and general accessibility of digital formats. I was really interested in the concept of art being similar to science in the way that works are only respected if they are exhibited, widely-spread, talked about, and replicated. I instantly thought of two creators on TikTok. Creator @sweetjoeyvermouth makes "bug art," where he goes through the intensive process of creating collages - coloring, printing, stamping, and placing bug stickers onto his work - all to video himself throwing his final piece into the trash. The creators act of trashing his final product drastically increases the dialogue surrounding his work, and despite the lack of a physical piece, his work is undoubtedly labelled as art due to the communitys response to his video documentation. Another user, @elishacreations, sells a regular, black bead on TikTok shop for $8. They make a ton of content promoting the bead in an over-the-top and almost satirical way - and viewers often describe the whole shop, videos, and experience as an art performance. Although its a simple and everyday thing, the act of promoting the bead in a dramatically silly way, makes the whole thing "art." While learning about alt-texts role in web accessibility, I was prompted to think about what disaffordances are embedded into a users journey across the web. I instantly thought of a practice/behavior Ive been noticing more and more on platforms like TikTok and Tumblr to help overcome barriers. These platforms are constantly evolving with new inside jokes and memes, and users will often spread and reference such jokes on unrelated content. This fast-moving culture feeds off itself, and it inevitably leaves some users out of the loop. Ive noticed some users adding alt-text when they reblog a post on Tumblr - and within this alt-text, they will include an explanation of the joke for users who may not understand. On TikTok, users are increasingly using phrases after their comments like "/serious" or "/joking" to signify the nature of their comment/question. This tag helps users with cognitive disabilities (or anyone, really) understand the tone of the commenter - while also aiding in avoiding conflict and confusion. Im curious about what other ways we can make the web more accessible. Soulellisconnections between the digital and physical worlds (e.g., posts, feeds, voices) makes me feel like I actions I take in the digital space are far more consequential and "real" than I usually understand them to be. A TikTok may take me mere minutes to make and privated only for my friends to view, but it is an interruption - a call for their attention. That thought is both heartwarming and scary. My response to this reading can be summarized by those two feelings. Soulellis brings up a possible near future - one where the "post" is replaced by a predictive, constant stream of fictional futures derived from static images - completely believable and indistinguishable from AI. Ive seen poor attempts of this type of content on TikTok - janky videos of AI babies growing up, the environment changing, etc. While my instant reaction is one of unease and very uncanny valley, Soulellis gives me the first sense of hope for the possibilities of this technology. He encourages further nurturing our feeds with love and truth, and disrupting the endless flow by archiving, printing, and altering content. It was very difficult for me to conceptualize Frenkels String Games and how it works. I had to look up plenty of explanations of the performance in order to understand its rules and components. My mind was so tied to the idea of a physical string pulling individuals that I could not separate the actual experiment from photos of the players rehearsal. I now understand that the strings are metaphorical words of meaning - personal to each game participant and representative of the networks that people create. I can also understand how, despite its current recognized importance, the piece was unfortunately not acknowledged during the late 1970s; its disconnect between virtual and physical spaces alongside the absence of a material thread, essential to the game itself, makes the performance transcendent on a level not previously touched. Im still not quite sure I understand how the performance plays out. When reading about the culture and common behaviors of Geocities users, I was hit with nostalgia for my obsessive Tumblr phase. I found countless parallels between the two platforms - the ability to personalize ones own webpage vs. the ability to personalize ones own blog; neighborhoods vs. fandoms; moving/update/construction announcements; links to other blogs and webpages creating a network between users. Perhaps, another relevant parallel is that both platforms were bought (and ruined?) by Yahoo.  As a teenage girl, the greatest appeal of Tumblr was the feeling of ownership - like I had a corner of the internet where I could rant, reblog posts about shows I cared about, and decorate my space to reflect what I liked. Thinking back to my first blog on Tumblr, although I unfortunately dont remember its URL, I clearly remember its rainbow font, space-themed background, and deeply cringe-worthy middle schooler introduction of myself. Im grateful for this unintentional archive Ive created for myself - an aged but truly raw glimpse into Sophia from 10 years ago. Nasser raises the point that choosing/building a common auxiliary language to build programming languages upon is an impossible task, as such a language must borrow structures from Chinese, Hindi, Arabic, etc - languages that are distinctly different. As someone who speaks Chinese, I tried to hypothesize what a programing language in Mandarin would even look like. In learning Mandarin as a child, I was taught pinyin - which is the romanization system of standard Chinese primarily used with those who are already familiar with the latin alphabet. Without such a system, it would be impossible to input Chinese characters into computers. I imagine a Chinese-based ecosystem would be vastly different - in the input, stringing, and organization of information, but I find myself so embedded within the English system that its difficult to detach. Ive never read about graphic design in such a politically-powerful context before. I enjoyed how the reading broke down the eras of modernism, post-modernism, and hyper-modernism - as well as providing example graphic design works for each. I did not expect to learn so much about the use of Disney motifs in critical design, but I find it fascinating and empowering that designers are able to protest the "Disneyization" of designers as cogs in one of the largest, globalizing capitalist forces by using Disneys own symbol. I think of Disneys consistent, mediocre, live-action remakes of their original animations in efforts to protect their copyright ownership - further cementing Disneys established language and legacy, and I wonder how critical designers are able to subvert/avoid such strict and dominant copyright laws. I studied Economics in my undergrad, and I now study Product Design here at Penn. I was driven to change fields due to my inability to reconcile the irrationalities/complexities of human beings with the clean/straight economic models that informed my studies. Steyerl talks about this problem in how economists (and the world) often mistake beauty in mathematical models, simulations, optimizations, etc ... as truth and reality. She dives into depressing cases of Google forcing users into unpaid labor and governments ranking individuals on the basis of social credit - all in efforts to derive utility from their models. However, Steyerl also ends the passage with an optimistic message - encouraging readers to take risks in creating a world they desire by acting as if it already exists. I like to think that Ive taken a part in that movement by pursuing my studies in design - moving away from economic models that portray large, aggregate behavior over time and into a deep respect and appreciation for human beings so that I can make things that they truly want.';
